#OED'S
###Omics-Enabled Detection and Studies primer design pipeline

A pipeline combining tools like bowtie2, SPAdes, Primer3 and blast for designing species specific primers

## Overview

This project is part of a PHD project in collaboration between ENZA Zaden, Netherlands and the university of Dundee, Scotland.
The main goal for this project is to design a easy-to-use tool to design species specific primers.
The tool combines two approaches to discover conserved regions by combining the information stored in the sequence data.

## Dependencies

The tool uses the following tools, and is tested with the menioned versions

## To-do

The to-do list contains all the parts that could be changed to increase the functionality or usability of OED'S.

* Start program with ready-made contigs instead of making the contigs in the pipeline. 
 * This will lower the total runtime of the program and the user can have direct influence on the quality of the contigs
* Test program to run with single-read sequence data
* Add config script for dependencies positions and other usability settings
