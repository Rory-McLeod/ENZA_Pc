#OED'S
###Omics-Enabled Detection and Studies primer design pipeline

A pipeline combining tools like bowtie2, SPAdes, Primer3 and blast for designing species specific primers

## Overview

This project is part of a PHD project in collaboration between ENZA Zaden, Netherlands and the university of Dundee, Scotland.
The main goal for this project is to design a easy-to-use tool to design species specific primers.
The tool combines two approaches to discover conserved regions by combining the information stored in the sequence data.
