"Omics-enabled detection and studies of Phytophthora capsici in the field"

Division of Plant Science, University of Dundee, Dundee. 
The James Hutton Institute, Invergowrie, Dundee. 
Enza Zaden, Enkhuizen, The Netherlands.

The project aims to build and characterise a toolset for diagnosing P. capsici in the field.
To do this, different strains of P. capsici are sequenced and compared against each other 
and other known Phytophthora species to find conserved region suitable for a diagnosing,
specifically P. capsici in the field.
